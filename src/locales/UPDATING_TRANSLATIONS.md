## Updating translations

Most phrases are contained in `soy` files. Other phrases used, such as userscript names and console messages are contained in `misc.json`.

`source.json` file is what is uploaded to tranlations platform. Do not modify it directly; it is automatically generated by executing `gulp i18n-extract`, combined from `misc.json` and `soy` files.

`userscript_keys.json`, `extension_keys.json`, and `userscript_settings_keys.json` files contain phrases that are needed in userscript and extensions, respectively. Those are automaticaly generated via `gulp i18n-extract` command.

`userscript_excluded.json` file contains phrases that are not needed in userscript. It is automatically updated via `gulp i18n-extract`.

`translations.json` file contains translations from tranlations platform. To update it, run `yarn locales:download`.
Use command `yarn locales:upload` if `source.json` was modified, it will upload it to tranlations platform.

`languages.js` file contains a list of languages we support in the Popup Blocker. It needs to be updated once more languages are fully translated on [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-applications).
