## Updating translations

Most phrases are contained in `soy` files. Other phrases used, such as userscript names and console messages are contained in `misc.json`.

`source.json` file is what is uploaded to onesky. Do not modify it directly; it is automatically generated by executing `gulp i18n-extract`, combined from `misc.json` and `soy` files.

`userscript_keys.json`, `extension_keys.json`, and `userscript_settings_keys.json` files contain phrases that are needed in userscript and extensions, respectively. Those are automaticaly generated via `gulp i18n-extract` command.

`userscript_excluded.json` file contains phrases that are not needed in userscript. It is automatically updated via `gulp i18n-extract`.

`translations.json` file contains translations from onesky. To update it, run `gulp i18n-down`.

`languages.js` file contains a list of languages we support in the Popup Blocker. It needs to be updated once more languages are fully translated on [OneSky](https://adguard.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=124184).
